Most improved pong version

Socket.io - Binding the front and back-end together with Node.js and Canvas
==========================================================================================

**Socket.IO aims to make realtime apps possible in every browser and mobile device, blurring the differences between the different transport mechanisms.**

Socket.io: HTML5's websockets live-chats, realtime collaboration applications, and multi-player games possible.

Simple 2-player game (that everyone should recognize) using Socket.io to handle our data.  It'll feature simple match making and (obviously) realtime play. Node.js will be handling our backend data and the visuals will be handled with HTML5's Canvas.
